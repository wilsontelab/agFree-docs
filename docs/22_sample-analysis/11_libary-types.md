The agFree pipelines are general-purpose tools that can analyze read 
data from a variety of sequencing platforms using a variety 
of libary construction strategies, including but not limited to 
the intended agFree approaches. 

### Supported agFree sequencing platforms

The sequencing platform, communicated via option `--sequencing-platform`,
defines how reads were generated by sequencer.
Currently supported sequencing platforms are:

- **IlluminaPE** = Illumina paired end reads
- **AvitiPE** = Element Aviti paired end reads
- **AvitiSE** = Element Aviti single reads
- **Ultima** = Ultimate single reads
- **ONT** = Oxford Nanpore single reads
- **PacBio** = PacBio Revio single reads

These platforms are defined in file 
{% include agFree-link.html text="platforms.csv" path="shared/modules/agFree/platforms.csv" %},
which can be modifed in your installation if you would like to 
adjust the default platform behaviors or 
define a new platform (follow the pattern and comments in the file).

A few key properties of the different platforms are whether 
reads are expected to be single or paired reads, whether reads always
go end-to-end on the sequenced insert, the expected base quality, etc.

### Supported agFree library types

The library type, communicated via option `--library-type`, 
defines how sequencing inserts were prepared prior to sequencing.
Currently supported sequencing libary types are:

- **tagFreeSR** = short reads generated by tagmentation of RE-fragmented DNA
- **tagFreeLR** = long reads generated by tagmentation of RE-fragmented DNA
- **ligFreeSR** = short reads generated by adapter ligation to RE-fragmented DNA
- **ligFreeLR** = long reads generated by adapter ligation to RE-fragmented DNA
- **otherTruSeq** = another Tru-seq compatible library prep (short read only)
- **otherTn5SR** = another short-read tagmentation libary
- **otherTn5LR** = another long-read tagmentation libary

These libary types are defined in file 
{% include agFree-link.html text="library_types.csv" path="shared/modules/agFree/library_types.csv" %},
which can be modifed in your installation if you would like to 
adjust the default libary behaviors or 
define a new libary type (follow the pattern and comments in the file).

### Supported restriction enzymes

Pipeline actions `af genome digest` and `af genotype digest` use the REs defined in the following files:
- {% include agFree-link.html text="blunt_enzymes.csv" path="shared/modules/REs/blunt_enzymes.csv" %} = blunt restriction enzymes
- {% include agFree-link.html text="overhang5_enzymes.csv" path="shared/modules/REs/overhang5_enzymes.csv" %} = 5' overhang restriction enzymes

The RE used to construct a sample library is communicated via option `--enzyme-name`.
It must match one of the REs listed in the files above.

If you need to use an RE not on these lists, 
you can edit the appropriate file in your installation to add an enzyme.
