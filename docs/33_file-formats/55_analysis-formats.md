### Analysis read inputs (name-sorted BAM)

The inputs to agFree variant analysis are (see previous pages for descriptions):
- name-sorted BAM files generated by `align genome|genotype`
- index RE sites files generated by `locate genome|genotype`

### Targeted analysis inputs (BED)

In some cases, your library may have been subjected to pre-sequencing target capture
or ONT adaptive sampling to enrich for target regions.

### Fragment analysis outputs

The first step in all agFree variant analysis is to filter and index the read alignments.
