# job file template for agFree pipeline action `genome download`
# to obtain haploid reference genomes in standardized formats
pipeline: agFree/genome:latest
variables:
    GENOMES: hs1 hg38 mm39 # thus, this job files downloads multiple genomes
download:
    download-genome:
        genome:     ${GENOMES}
    output:
        output-dir: ${PWD}/_download_genomes # the working directory, not where genomes will be downloaded
        data-name:  ${GENOMES}
execute:
    - download

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# at present, the best choice for obtaining exclusion regions for genome hs1
# is to manually download the bed format (not bed.gz format) file:
#     T2T.excluderanges.bed
# from Google Drive:
#     https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sF9m8Y3eZouTZ3IEEywjs2kfHOWFBSJT/
# to this exact path and file name:
