## {{page.title}}

We provide templates for job files for all agFree pipeline actions.

Note that these job file templates are broken down into pieces
to introduce the concepts and structures. In actual use,
you may want to use composite job files that string
calls to multiple pipelines together in a single file, [as 
described here](https://midataint.github.io/mdi/docs/job_config_files.html#multi-pipeline-job-files).
